# Amazon-TV-and-Movies-Project
This project developed a descriptive analytics dashboard to evaluate content performance and viewer preferences on Amazon Prime Video. Using a dataset obtained via web scraping, the analysis explored key metrics including content types, genre popularity, geographical distribution, and rating trends.

The dashboard was built with Power BI after initial data cleaning in Excel, revealing that movies significantly outperform TV shows, with drama and action genres being most popular globally. The United States and India emerged as the largest content markets, while ratings analysis showed 13+ content as most prevalent.

Key insights informed strategic recommendations for content development, regional targeting, and genre expansion to enhance viewer engagement and platform growth.
